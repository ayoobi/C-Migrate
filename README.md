# C-Migrate: A Context-Aware Service Migration Framework for Mobile Edge Computing

**C-Migrate** is a comprehensive framework for intelligent service migration in mobile edge computing environments. It addresses the core challenge of maintaining seamless service quality for mobile users by proactively relocating user services to optimal edge servers.

The framework synergistically integrates high-fidelity trajectory prediction with context-aware optimization. Its main components are:

*   **SpatioFormer:** An encoder-only transformer model that forecasts user mobility with high accuracy.
*   **Hybrid SA-DQN:** A Hybrid Simulated Annealing with Deep Q-network refinement algorithm that formulates server selection as a constraint-based facility location problem, informed by the mobility predictions.

C-Migrate uniquely incorporates a multi-dimensional context model, enabling migrations that are not only spatially efficient but also personalized to dynamic user conditions (e.g., in mobile healthcare). In large-scale urban mobility evaluations, our framework demonstrates a **9-11% reduction** in service migrations using trajectory prediction alone, and a significant **68-73% reduction** when user context is considered, outperforming state-of-the-art baselines.
